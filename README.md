## ⚙️ How It Works

1. User connects their wallet (MetaMask)
2. The app checks if the user has at least 0.01 ETH on **Ethereum Mainnet**
3. If eligible and 24 hours have passed since the last request, the contract sends **0.1 Sepolia ETH**

* Mainnet balance verification is done on the **frontend** using a remote provider.
* User activity is limited to one request per 24 hours to avoid draining the faucet.
